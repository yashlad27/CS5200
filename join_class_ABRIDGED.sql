-- Review UNION and JOIN
-- OUTER JOIN (LEFT, RIGHT)
-- NESTED QUERIES 
-- these operations allows us to gather information 
-- from multiple tables 

 use AP;

-- UNION allows you to glue the results of 2 or more 
-- SQL SELECT commands together
-- example
-- retrieve all vendor_ids in the ap database.

 
 -- JOIN
 -- Many times, the data you want in your result is in multiple tables.
-- The JOIN operation allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables 
-- and put semantic restrictions 
-- on the result tuples when needed.
-- It is typically considered analogous to multiplication since 
-- if table A has m tuples and table B has n tuples, 
-- A JOIN B can have as many as m*n tuples. 
-- There are two different syntaxes for  expressing a JOIN: 
-- the implicit join and the explicit join.
select invoice_id from inovices;

-- The implicit join is the older method for expressing a join and is not used in industry

-- Last week you saw different syntaxes for JOIN as well as different variations of JOIN 
-- We are focused on the explicit INNER JOIN 

-- JOIN between the vendors and the invoices table
-- explicit join syntax 
-- SELECT select_list
-- FROM table_1
--    [INNER] JOIN table_2
 --      ON join_condition_1
 --  [[INNER] JOIN table_3
 --       ON join_condition_2]...
 SELECT * FROM invoices join vendors ON vendors.vendor_id = invoices.vendor_id;
 
  
  -- verification of the results by counting records 
  
  -- add as many tables as I need to get the results I want 
select vendor_name, invoice_id, invoice_total, invoice_sequence, line_item_amount FROM vendors join invoices using (vendor_id) join invoice_line_items
on invoice_line_items.invoice_id = invoices.invoice_id;
  
-- check the number of tuples returned 

-- We can add as many tables as we need 
 


 -- example of a self join 
-- sometimes the data you want to JOIN is in the same table 
-- for example what if we wanted to identify vendors in the same city 
-- must use table aliases to distinguish the two copies of the same table 
-- each field needs to be prefixed with the table name for disambiguation
select v1.vendor_name as vendor1, v2.vendor_name as vendor2, v1.vendor_city
from vendors as v1 join vendors as v2 
on v1.vendor_city = v2.vendor_city 
and v1.vendor_state = v2.vendor_state
and v1.vendor_name < v2.vendor_name
order by vendor1, vendor2;

select vendor_city, group_concat(vendor_name)
from vendors
group by vendor_city;


-- An OUTER JOIN allows you to specify one of the tables as always contributing to the result. 
-- show Venn diagram for an OUTER JOIN 
-- Example of an OUTER JOIN 
-- OUTER keyword is optional 
-- There are 2 types of OUTER JOINS: LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. 
-- LEFT OUTER JOIN specifies that the tuples in the table to the LEFT of the JOIN keyword always contributes to the result. 
-- RIGHT OUTER JOIN specifies that the tuples in the table to the RIGHT of the JOIN keyword always contributes to the result
 -- SELECT select_list
-- FROM table_1
   --  {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER] JOIN table_2
    --     ON join_condition_1
  --  [{LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER] JOIN table_3
   --      ON join_condition_2]...
   -- want to report on the vendors for an invoice BUT you also want report on ALL vendors 
   
   -- every invoices is represented in result. 114 tuples
  select vendor_name, invoice_id, invoice_total
  from invoices left outer join vendors using (vendor_id);

-- every vendor needs to be in my result:  202 tuples
select vendor_name, invoice_id, invoice_total
  from invoices right outer join vendors using (vendor_id);
  
  
-- Aggregation with an OUTER JOIN
-- Example of an OUTER JOIN - 
select vendor_name, sum(invoice_total) as vendor_total 
from invoices right outer join vendors using(vendor_id)
group by vendor_name;
      
-- find all vendors whose sum is NULL
select vendor_name, sum(invoice_total) as vendor_total 
from invoices right outer join vendors using(vendor_id)
group by vendor_name
having vendor_total is null;
   


      
-- ALSO YOU can mix the types of JOINS you want.  One query can have NATURAL, OUTER, and INNER JOINs within it. 
-- Letâ€™s say you want to retrieve for each vendor the description of the terms used.

select vendor_name, invoice_total, invoice_sequence, line_item_amount 
from vendors left outer join invoices using(vendor_id)
inner join invoice_line_items using (invoice_id);

-- NESTED QUERIES 
-- what if you wanted invoices above the average invoice??
-- I want to write 
-- SELECT invoice_id, invoice_total FROM invoices 
  -- WHERE invoice_total > ?????
-- you know how to write a query to find the average value for a column 

SELECT avg(invoice_total) FROM invoices;
-- this returns a number - I want to use this number when filtering my invoices
-- we can use the query as a subquery in a query 
-- Find invoices above the average 
select vendor_name, invoice_id, invoice_total from invoices as i join vendors as v
on i.vendor_id = v.vendor_id 
where invoice_total > (select avg(invoice_total) from invoices);

-- what if you want the vendor_name as well
-- we need a JOIN 
-- Find invoices above the average report the vendor_name and the invoice_id 


  -- Here we introduce a subquery in the WHERE clause 
  
  
-- How do you think a query like this is implemented by the DBMS? 
-- It computes the subquery then use that value in the outer query 
-- 1. get the value for : SELECT avg(invoice_total) FROM invoices - call it x.
-- 2. run the outer query with x : SELECT invoice_id, invoice_total WHERE onvoice_total > x;
-- This is known as an uncorrelated query. The subquery is run only once for the outer query. 


-- This is an example of a nested query 
-- In SQL we can place a subquery in the following places
-- In a WHERE clause as a search condition
-- In a HAVING clause as a search condition
-- In the FROM clause as a table specification
-- In the SELECT clause as a column specification


-- The above example has the subquery in the WHERE clause
-- SUBQUERIES ARE ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY PARENTHESES  
-- A subquery can return a single value, a list of values or a table of values.
-- A subquery may contain other subqueries. 

  
  
-- A common way to introduce a query in the WHERE clause is with the IN OPERATOR
-- example: find all invoices for Californian vendors

select * from invoices where invoice_id in (21, 31, 39);

select * from invoices where vendor_id in
(select vendor_id from vendors where vendor_state = 'CA');

select i.* from invoices as i join vendors using(vendor_id) 
where vendor_state = 'CA';    -- using vendors table to filter invoices

-- query should return only 1 field 

  
  -- can use more than 1 field for matching with IN 
  
  
  
-- example of a nested query in the SELECT clause
-- you want to report the average invoice for each vendor 
-- first show average across all vendors
use ap;

-- correlated query
select invoice_id, invoice_total, 
 (select avg(invoice_total) from invoices as inner_i
 where outer_i.vendor_id = inner_i.vendor_id) as avg_invoice
 from invoices as outer_i;
 

-- more useful to report the average per vendor as oppose to across all invoices 
select invoice_id, invoice_total, 
 (select avg(invoice_total) from invoices as inner_i
 where outer_i.vendor_id = inner_i.vendor_id) as avg_invoice
 from invoices as outer_i;
 
-- this is a correlated query the inner query is run for each tuple in the outer query

-- This nested query can be rewritten as a JOIN
-- we still need to nest since we need to compute the average for each vendor

-- 34 averages 
select vendor_id, avg(invoice_total) as vendor_avg from invoices 
group by vendor_id; 

select invoice_id, t.vendor_id, vendor_avg from invoices join 
(select vendor_id, avg(invoice_total) as vendor_avg from invoices 
group by vendor_id ) as t t.vendor_id = invoices.vendor_id;
-- Can you think of another way to write the same query? 

 
  
-- More complicated nested query 
-- nested queries find all vendors whose invoices total is above the average for all vendors 
-- break up into steps compute the average for all vendors
-- 1. first need to find the total amount for each vendor
-- 2. Compute the average across all vendors 
-- 3. Use this average to filter the result from query 1. 


-- want to compute the average of these values 
-- I create a nested query where the FROM is this query result 
-- here we introduce the subquery in the FROM clause 


-- Here WE Introduce a query in the FROM clause as well as the HAVING clause       

      
-- If this seems a bit redundant to you you can also express the query
-- using a common table expression 
-- this way the duplicated subquery is not written in the query twice

  
  
  -- CREATE A TABLE FROM THE RESULT OF A QUERY
  


-- sometimes there is a disconnect between the return values from the subquery and the outer query

  -- ANY, ALL 
  
  -- generates an error since the outer query needs one value for the comparison instead of a list of values 
 
    
    -- ALL WILL RETURN TRUE IF THE CONDITION IS MET FOR ALL VALUES FROM THE SUBQUERY

    
    
 --   With a correlated query the inner query has access to the field values in the outer query. 
 -- For each tuple in the outer query the inner query is computed.  
 -- A correlated query is comparable to executing a loop in a host language.

    -- EXISTS and NOT EXISTS 
    -- SOMETIMES YOU DO NOT CARE WHAT THE VALUES ARE IN THE DATABASE YOU ARE ONLY CONCERNED
    -- WITH THE EXISTENCE OF THE RESULT IN THE DB
    -- IF THIS IS TRUE CAN USE not exists or exists 
    
 
      
      -- Negate it to find the vendors without invoices 
      

-- EXAMPLE OF A CORRELATED QUERY 

-- We do have other SET OPERATIONS IN SQL
-- We do not have a keyword for INTERSECTION but we do have many ways to simulate INTERSECTION in MySQL. 
-- The simplest is the IN operator or with an INNER JOIN. We will look at other methods when we review subqueries.

-- SET DIFFERENCE we do not have a keyword for SET DIFFERENCE but we do have many ways to simulate SET DIFFERENCE in MySQL. 
-- The simplest in the NOT IN operator or with an OUTER JOIN. We will look at other methods when we review subqueries.
